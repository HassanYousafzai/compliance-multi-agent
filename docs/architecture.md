# System Architecture

## Overview
The Compliance-Aware Multi-Agent System is designed to provide intelligent data exploration while ensuring regulatory compliance through a coordinated multi-agent architecture.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Agent System
```
EnhancedComplianceAwareAgentSystem (Orchestrator)
├── RetrievalAgent (Data Acquisition)
├── EnhancedReasoningAgent (Intelligent Analysis)
├── EnhancedComplianceAgent (Regulatory Validation)
└── EnhancedMemorySystem (Learning & Persistence)
```

### 2. Data Flow
1. **Query Input** → User submits query
2. **Retrieval Phase** → Fetch data from sources/APIs
3. **Reasoning Phase** → Multi-step analysis with chain-of-thought
4. **Compliance Phase** → Regulatory validation (HIPAA/GDPR)
5. **Memory Phase** → Learning and persistence
6. **Output** → Structured insights with compliance status

### 3. Agent Responsibilities

#### Retrieval Agent
- Fetches data from external APIs
- Handles API failures gracefully
- Provides mock data for demonstration
- Supports multiple data types (weather, medical, business)

#### Enhanced Reasoning Agent
- Performs multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning
- Generates hypotheses and insights
- Identifies patterns and correlations
- Provides confidence scoring
- Context-aware analysis

#### Enhanced Compliance Agent
- Validates data against HIPAA regulations
- Validates data against GDPR requirements
- Checks data retention policies
- Provides detailed violation reports
- Learning from compliance patterns

#### Enhanced Memory System
- SQLite-based persistent storage
- Query success rate tracking
- Compliance violation logging
- Agent performance monitoring
- System insights generation
- Learning and recommendation engine

## Design Principles

### Think-Act-Learn-Govern Cycle
- **Think**: Reasoning agent analyzes and understands data
- **Act**: Retrieval agent acquires and processes data  
- **Learn**: Memory system captures patterns and improves
- **Govern**: Compliance agent ensures regulatory adherence

### Enterprise Scalability
- Modular agent architecture
- Persistent learning system
- Comprehensive logging and analytics
- Configurable compliance rules
- Performance monitoring

### Compliance by Design
- Regulatory checks integrated into core workflow
- Automated violation detection
- Audit trail generation
- Configurable rule sets
