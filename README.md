## **Step 12: Test Everything**

Now let's test all components:

```bash
# Test the core system
python run_system.py examples

# Test interactive mode
python run_system.py interactive
# Then type "What's the weather in London?" and see the response
# Type "quit" to exit

# Run the demo
python run_system.py demo

# Run performance tests
python examples/performance_test.py

# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
Step 13: Set Up GitHub
Now let's push everything to GitHub:

bash
# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Compliance-Aware Multi-Agent System with enhanced agents, memory system, and comprehensive testing"

# Create GitHub repository (go to GitHub.com and create a new repository)
# Then add the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/compliance-multi-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
